# ✨ Hi! ✨
- 🪐 I'm a Rust developer specializing in high-loaded distributed cloud applications built with microservices, with over five years of experience.
- 🍴 I've eaten a crab writing microservices.
- 🪄 My technical expertise spans from low-level wizzardry like C++ programming and embeded Rust to magical concepts like lambda calculus and type theory.
- 🎲 Outside of technology, I'm a professional tabletop D&D 5th edition player.
