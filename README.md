# ✨ Hi! ✨
- 🪐 I'm a primarily System-level Backend developer for 5+ years already. Yet on variety of projects also took frontend and leading roles.
- 🍴 I've eaten a crab writing microservices.
- 🪄 Depending on project specification I did lots of embedded Rust, Python and ffi bindings for it, TypeScript and web frontend, GLSL and GPU computing, C# for Unity, CI/CD pipelines.
- 🎓 Led as a tech lead multiple small teams (3-5 members) on variety of projects (4 total), did onboarding / code review / mentorship for new developers.
- 🎲 Outside of technology, I'm a professional tabletop D&D 5th edition player.
